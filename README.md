# YouTube Uninterrupted Extension

A Chrome extension (Firefox support will most likely be added in the future) which adds extra functionality to YouTube. 
The following things are being added to YouTube.

- A replay button which lets you replay videos as long as you want with a single button click.
- Automatically skips/closes ads (NOTE! Ads can still briefly appear, as they're only skipped/closed! 
Therefore, content creators will still receive ad revenue).  
- Quicker autoplay of videos, which means there is no longer a five second delay before the next video starts playing.  
- Disables the annoying YouTube autostop function which appears after a while of YouTube idly playing videos.  

All of the above listed functionality can individually be disabled through the extension's own menu.
